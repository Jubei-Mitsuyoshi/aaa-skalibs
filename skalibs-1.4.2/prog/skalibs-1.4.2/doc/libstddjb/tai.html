<h1> The <tt>tai</tt> library interface </h1>

<p>
 The following functions are declared in the <tt>tai.h</tt> header,
and implemented in the <tt>libstddjb.a</tt> or <tt>libstddjb.so</tt> library.
</p>

<h2> General information </h2>

<p>
 <tt>tai</tt> is a set of data structures and primitives to represent
and perform operations on time.
</p>

<p>
 The point of <tt>tai</tt> is to handle time without ever having to
deal with annoyances such as Y2K, Y2038, NTP limits, non-linear
clocks, and the like. By using the <tt>tai</tt> interface, you ensure
your program will behave properly no matter what.
</p>

<h3> What is the problem&nbsp;? </h3>

<p>
 The standard APIs for time management under Unix are broken in more
or less subtle ways. The most obvious thing is that they do not pass
year 2038. A less obvious problem is that they do not handle leap
seconds correctly. Here are a few references you should read to
understand what is going on:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <a href="http://www.madore.org/~david/misc/time.html">David Madore's page
on time</a>. It's outdated (there was a leap second in 2009), but complete. </li>
 <li> From David Madore again, more to the point: a
<a href="http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/unix-leap-seconds.html">page
about leap seconds, UTC and TAI</a>. </li>
 <li> The skalibs <a href="../flags.html#clockistai">flag-clockistai</a>
and <a href="../flags.html#tzisright">flag-tzisright</a> documentation. </li>
 <li> <a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/utctai.html">Dan J. Bernstein's page
on UTC, TAI and Unix time</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The meat and potatoes of all this is that programmers cannot simply rely on
standard Unix APIs such as
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/gettimeofday.html">gettimeofday()</a>
to measure time intervals or even to give precise absolute time, and in
any case those APIs will become obsolete in 2038.
</p>

<h3> So what does <tt>tai</tt> do&nbsp;? </h3>

<p>
 <tt>tai</tt> implements - among other things - the
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html">TAI64, TAI64N and TAI64NA</a>
formats, which are used in all of skalibs. This gives a programmer access
to precise <em>linear absolute time</em>, which is suitable for both
timestamping (<em>wallclock</em> usage) and time interval measurements
(<em>stopwatch</em> usage). Additionally, TAI64 passes Y2038 (it can
represent dates exceeding the estimated lifespan of the universe).
</p>

<p>
 <tt>tai</tt> has been inspired by Dan J. Bernstein's
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/libtai.html">libtai</a> library, but does not
borrow any code from it.
</p>

<h2> Data structures </h2>

<p>
 A <tt>struct tai</tt> structure holds an absolute date with a one-second
precision. A <tt>struct taia</tt> structure holds an absolute date with a
maximum of one-attosecond precision, as permitted by the underlying system
call. If <a href="../flags.html#usert">flag-usert</a> is clear, the system
clock will be read via
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/gettimeofday.html">gettimeofday()</a>
system call, which has a one-microsecond precision; if it is set, the
system clock will be read via the 
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/clock_gettime.html">clock_gettime()</a>
system call, which has a one-nanosecond precision. In either case, a current
<tt>struct taia</tt> will be unable to be more precise than the underlying
implementation.
</p>

<p>
 A <tt>struct tai</tt>, as well as a <tt>struct taia</tt>, can also
hold a (possibly negative) relative time, i.e. a difference of absolute
dates. It is up to the programmer to make sure that a relative time is
never interpreted as an absolute TAI64 date, and vice-versa.
</p>

<h3> The leap second table </h3>

<p>
 skalibs provides a <tt>/package/prog/skalibs/etc/leapsecs.dat</tt> file,
which is copied to <tt>/etc/leapsecs.dat</tt> at installation time.
<strong>Make sure this file is always present and readable.</strong>
This file contains the <em>leap second table</em>, which is needed for
conversions between TAI and UTC. If you call a function that needs such
a conversion (for instance, you call <tt>taia_sysclock()</tt> and your
system clock is set to UTC) and the file cannot be read, the function
call will fail.
</p>

<p>
 The leap second table is read once in every process that needs it
(the first time a TAI &harr; UTC conversion is made) and then is
stored in memory. If the <tt>leapsecs.dat</tt> file changes, long-lived
processes will need to be restarted to take the change into account.
</p>

<h2> Functions </h2>

<h3> Wallclock operations </h3>

<p>
<code> int tai_now (struct tai *t) </code> <br />
Writes the current time as a TAI value to *<em>t</em>, with a
1-second precision. The current time is based on the system clock.
Make sure you have set or cleared the
<a href="../flags.html#clockistai">flag-clockistai</a> according
to your system clock synchronization method: skalibs supports a
system clock set to TAI-10 or to UTC.
The function returns 1 if it succeeds, or 0 (and sets errno) if
it fails.
</p>

<p>
<code> int sysclock_get (struct taia *a) </code> <br />
Reads the current value of the system clock into *<em>a</em>, with
a 1-nanosecond (resp. 1-microsecond) if
<a href="../flags.html#usert">flag-usert</a> is set (resp. clear)
precision. Returns 1 if it succeeds or 0 (and sets errno) if it
fails. Note that despite being a <tt>struct taia</tt>, *<em>a</em>
<strong>does not contain a TAI value</strong> - it only contains
an internal, Y2038-safe representation of the value of the system
clock, which should be either TAI-10 or UTC. You should not use
this function directly unless you know exactly what you are doing.
</p>

<p>
<code> int sysclock_set (struct taia const *a) </code> <br />
Sets the system clock to *<em>a</em>, provided *<em>a</em> has
the correct internal representation. You should not use this
function directly unless you know exactly what you are doing.
</p>

<p>
<code> int taia_sysclock (struct taia *a) </code> <br />
Reads the current time into *<em>a</em>, as a TAI64NA value,
with a 1-nanosecond (resp. 1-microsecond) if 
<a href="../flags.html#usert">flag-usert</a> is set (resp. clear) 
precision. Returns 1 if it succeeds or 0 (and sets errno) if it
fails.
 Here <em>a</em> contains a valid TAI stamp, no matter what the
system clock is set to: arithmetic operations can be performed
on it.
</p>

<p>
<code> int taia_setnow (struct taia const *a) </code> <br />
Sets the current time to *<em>a</em>, with a 1-nanosecond
(resp. 1-microsecond) if 
<a href="../flags.html#usert">flag-usert</a> is set (resp. clear) 
precision. Returns 1 if it succeeds or 0 (and sets errno) if it
fails. <em>a</em> must contain a valid TAI stamp; proper
operations will be automatically run to convert that stamp into
the right format for the system clock.
</p>

<h3> Stopwatch operations </h3>

<p>
 The following 3 operations are only defined if your system
provides the
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/clock_gettime.html">clock_gettime()</a>
primitive with the CLOCK_MONOTONIC option.
</p>

<p>
<code> int taia_clockmon_init (struct taia *offset) </code> <br />
Initializes a stopwatch in *<em>offset</em>. The actual value of
*<em>offset</em> is meaningless to the user; <em>offset</em>'s only
use is to be given as a second parameter to <tt>taia_clockmon()</tt>.
The function returns 1 if it succeeds or 0 (and sets errno) if it fails.
</p>

<p>
 What <tt>taia_clockmon_init()</tt> does is synchronize the "stopwatch
clock" (CLOCK_MONOTONIC) to the system clock. Right after
<tt>taia_clockmon_init()</tt> has been called, the absolute times given
by <tt>taia_clockmon()</tt> and <tt>taia_sysclock()</tt> are similar. Then,
depending on the accuracy of the system clock, a drift may appear; calling
<tt>taia_clockmon_init()</tt> again resets that drift to zero.
</p>

<p>
<code> int taia_clockmon (struct taia *a, struct taia const *offset) </code> <br />
 Gives the absolute time, as a TAI64NA value, in *<em>a</em>. This
absolute time is computed as a linear increase (as measured with
CLOCK_MONOTONIC) since the last time <tt>taia_clockmon_init()</tt>
was called with parameter <em>offset</em>. <tt>taia_clockmon()</tt>
guarantees precise time interval measurements; however, the time it
gives can slightly differ from the result of <tt>taia_sysclock()</tt>.
The function returns 1 if it succeeds or 0 (and sets errno) if it fails.
</p>

<h3> All-purpose time reading </h3>

<p>
<code> int taia_init (void) </code> <br />
If <a href="../flags.html#usemon">flag-usemon</a> is set: this
function initializes a process-global stopwatch, that future
<tt>taia_now</tt> invocations will depend on.
If <a href="../flags.html#usemon">flag-usemon</a> is clear: this
function does nothing.
The function returns 1 if it succeeds or 0 (and sets errno) if it fails.
</p>

<p>
<code> int taia_now (struct taia *a) </code> <br />
Writes the current time, as a TAI value, to *<em>a</em>. This is the
function you should use to read time by default. It returns 1 if it succeeds or
0 (and sets errno) if it fails.
</p>

<p>
 If <a href="../flags.html#usemon">flag-usemon</a> is set:
<tt>taia_now()</tt> is computed as a linear increase from the last time
<tt>taia_init()</tt> was called. (If <tt>taia_init()</tt> has never
been called before, the first invocation of <tt>taia_now()</tt>
automatically calls <tt>taia_init()</tt>.)
 If <a href="../flags.html#usemon">flag-usemon</a> is clear:
<tt>taia_now()</tt> is the same as <tt>taia_sysclock()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
 If all of the above is unclear to you: just use <tt>taia_now()</tt>
everytime you need to read time, and you will always get a reasonable
approximation of the current time, in a format suited for arithmetic
computations.
</p>

<h3> Converting to/from libc representations </h3>

<p>
<code> int tai_from_timeval (struct tai *t, struct timeval const *tv) <br />
int tai_from_timespec (struct tai *t, struct timespec const *ts) <br />
int tai_relative_from_timeval (struct tai *t, struct timeval const *tv) <br />
int tai_relative_from_timespec (struct tai *t, struct timespec const *ts) </code> <br />
Those functions convert an absolute (resp. relative) time in a
struct timeval (resp. struct timespec) to an absolute (resp. relative)
time in a struct tai, with a 1-second precision. They return 1.
</p>

<p>
<code> int timeval_from_tai (struct timeval *tv, struct tai const *t) <br />
int timespec_from_tai (struct timespec *ts, struct tai const *t) <br />
int timeval_from_tai_relative (struct timeval *tv, struct tai const *t) <br />
int timespec_from_tai_relative (struct timespec *ts, struct tai const *t) </code> <br />
Those functions do the opposite conversion. They normally return 1;
however, <tt>struct timeval</tt> and <tt>struct timespec</tt> cannot
represent an absolute date before the Epoch, or a negative relative time;
if *<em>t</em> cannot be converted, 0 EINVAL is returned.
</p>

<p>
<code> int taia_from_timeval (struct taia *a, struct timeval const *tv) <br />
int taia_from_timespec (struct taia *a, struct timespec const *ts) <br />
int taia_relative_from_timeval (struct taia *a, struct timeval const *tv) <br />
int taia_relative_from_timespec (struct taia *a, struct timespec const *ts) <br />
int timeval_from_taia (struct timeval *tv, struct taia const *a) <br />
int timespec_from_taia (struct timespec *ts, struct taia const *a) <br />
int timeval_from_taia_relative (struct timeval *tv, struct taia const *a) <br />
int timespec_from_taia_relative (struct timespec *ts, struct taia const *a) </code> <br />
Same conversion operations, but with a <tt>struct taia</tt>. The 1-microsecond
(for <tt>struct timeval</tt>) or 1-nanosecond (for <tt>struct timespec</tt>)
precision is preserved.
</p>

<p>
<code> void taia_uint (struct taia *a, unsigned int c) </code> <br />
Stores a relative time of <em>c</em> seconds into <em>a</em>.
</p>

<p>
<code> int taia_from_millisecs (struct taia *a, int ms) </code> <br />
This function makes a <tt>struct taia</tt> representing a relative
time of <em>ms</em> milliseconds. <em>ms</em> must be non-negative.
The function returns 1, unless <em>ms</em> is negative, in which case
it returns 0 EINVAL.
</p>

<p>
<code> int taia_to_millisecs (struct taia const *a) </code> <br />
If *<em>a</em> contains a non-negative relative time that fits into
a 31-bit integer number of milliseconds, the function returns that
number. Else it returns -1 EINVAL.
</p>

<h3> Time computations </h3>

<p>
<code> void tai_add (struct tai *t, struct tai const *t1, struct tai const *t2) </code> <br />
Stores *<em>t1</em> + *<em>t2</em> into <em>t</em>. Of course, *<em>t1</em>
and *<em>t2</em> must not both represent absolute times.
</p>

<p>
<code> void tai_sub (struct tai *t, struct tai const *t1, struct tai const *t2) </code> <br />
Stores *<em>t1</em> - *<em>t2</em> into <em>t</em>. Of course, *<em>t1</em>
and *<em>t2</em> must be of the same type (relative or absolute), and
*<em>t</em> will always be relative.
</p>

<p>
<code> void taia_add (struct taia *a, struct taia const *a1, struct taia const *a2) <br />
void taia_sub (struct taia *a, struct taia const *a1, struct taia const *a2) </code> <br />
Same thing with <tt>struct taia</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<code> void taia_addsec (struct taia *a, struct taia const *a1, int c) </code> <br />
Adds <em>c</em> seconds to *<em>a1</em> and stores the result into <em>a</em>.
<em>c</em> may be negative.
</p>

<p>
<code> void taia_half (struct taia *a, struct taia const *b) </code> <br />
Stores *<em>b</em>/2 into <em>a</em>. *<em>b</em> must be relative.
</p>

<h3> Comparing dates or durations </h3>

<p>
<code> int tai_less (struct tai const *t1, struct tai const *t2) <br />
int taia_less (struct taia const *t1, struct taia const *t2) </code> <br />
Those functions return nonzero iff *<em>t1</em> is lesser than *<em>t2</em>.
*<em>t1</em> and *<em>t2</em> must be both relative, or both absolute.
</p>

<h3> Packing and unpacking </h3>

<p>
<code> void tai_pack (char *s, struct tai const *t) </code> <br />
Marshalls *<em>t</em> into the buffer <em>s</em> points to, which
must be preallocated with at least TAI_PACK (8) characters. Afterwards,
the buffer contains the
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html#tai64">external TAI64 format</a>
representation of *<em>t</em>.
</p>

<p>
<code> void tai_unpack (char const *s, struct tai *t) </code> <br />
Unmarshalls the
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html#tai64">external TAI64 format</a>
label pointed to by <em>s</em> (at least TAI_PACK characters) and stores
the result into <em>t</em>.
</p>

<p>
<code> void tain_pack (char *s, struct taia const *a) <br />
void tain_unpack (char const *s, struct taia *a) <br />
void taia_pack (char *s, struct taia const *a) <br />
void taia_unpack (char const *s, struct taia *a) </code> <br />
Same thing with
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html#tai64n">external TAI64N format</a>,
using TAIN_PACK (12) characters, and
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html#tai64na">external TAI64NA format</a>,
using TAIA_PACK (16) characters. Note that a <tt>struct taia</tt> is used in
both cases; there is no specific internal representation of TAI64N.
</p>

<h3> Formatting and scanning </h3>

<p>
<code> unsigned int tain_fmt (char *s, struct taia const *a) </code> <br />
Writes into <em>s</em> an ASCII representation of *<em>a</em> in external
TAI64N format. <em>s</em> must point to a preallocated buffer of at least
TAIN_PACK*2 (24) characters. The function returns the number of bytes that
have been written to <em>s</em> (24).
</p>

<p>
<code> unsigned int tain_scan (char const *s, struct taia *a) </code> <br />
Reads 24 characters from <em>s</em>; if those characters are a valid ASCII
representation of the external TAI64N format of some time value, this value
is stored into <em>a</em>, and 24 is returned. Else 0 is returned.
</p>

<p>
<code> unsigned int taia_fmt (char *s, struct taia const *a) <br />
unsigned int taia_scan (char const *s, struct taia *a) </code> <br />
Same thing with 32 characters and the TAI64NA format.
</p>

<a name="timestamp"><h3> Timestamping </h3></a>

<p>
 A <em>TAI64N timestamp</em> is a string of 25 characters: a single '@'
character followed by the ASCII representation of the TAI64N external
format of an absolute date.
</p>

<p>
<code> unsigned int timestamp_fmt (char *s, struct taia const *a) </code> <br />
Writes a TAI64N timestamp representing the absolute date *<em>a</em>
into the 25 characters pointed to by <em>s</em>. Returns 25.
</p>

<p>
<code> unsigned int timestamp_scan (char const *s, struct taia *a) </code> <br />
Reads 25 characters at <em>s</em>. If those characters are a valid TAI64N
timestamp, stores the absolute date in <em>a</em> and returns 25. Else,
returns 0.
</p>

<p>
<code> int timestamp (char *s) </code> <br />
Writes the current time (read from the system clock) as a TAI64N timestamp
into <em>s</em>. Returns 1 if it succeeds or 0 (and sets errno) if it fails.
</p>

<p>
 TAI64N timestamps are an efficient, robust, and easy-to-use way of
timestampping log lines. They're easy to recognize in automatic data
parsers. Log files where every line starts with a TAI64N timestamp can
be merged and alphanumerically sorted: the resulting file will be
chronologically sorted.
</p>

<p>
 The <a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6/">s6</a> package
provides tools to convert TAI64N timestamps into human-readable
dates. Please do not embed human-readable dates in your log files,
thus making parsing tools unnecessarily hard to write;
use TAI64N timestamps instead, design tools that can parse them,
and translate them to human-readable form at human analysis time.
