<h1> Safe wrappers </h1>

<p>
 Lots of functions in <tt>libstddjb</tt>, declared for instance in
<a href="allreadwrite.html">allreadwrite.h</a> or
<a href="djbunix.html">djbunix.h</a>, are just "safe wrappers"
around corresponding system functions. For instance,
<tt>fd_read()</tt> is a safe wrapper around the system <tt>read()</tt>
function.
</p>

<h2> The problem </h2>

<p>
 Quite a lot of system calls are defined by
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/nfindex.html">the
Single Unix Specification v4</a> as interruptible: when the process is in
the middle of such a system call and receives a signal that it does not
ignore, the system call immediately returns -1 EINTR (after the signal
handler, if any, has been executed).
</p>

<p>
 This means that the intended execution of the process is at the mercy
of a stray signal. If a signal happens at the wrong time, a system call
fails when it could have succeeded. This is not acceptable.
</p>

<h2> The solution </h2>

<p>
 So, in order to be perfectly reliable, when a program makes an interruptible
system call, it <em>must</em> check whether the return value is -1 EINTR,
and restart the system call if it is the case. This is annoying to write;
so, <tt>libstddjb</tt> provides small wrappers around interruptible system
calls, so that programmers can just call those <em>safe wrappers</em> and
never bother with this again.
</p>

<p>
 The performance loss from having a wrapper layer is totally negligible
compared to the cost of using a system call in the first place.
</p>

<h2> But isn't it what the SA_RESTART flag is meant to address? </h2>

<p>
 Yes, it is. Unfortunately, SA_RESTART only protects interruptible
system calls from signals you actually have control over, and set a
handler for with
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sigaction.html">sigaction()</a>.
This is not enough. You cannot decide that <em>every</em> signal sent
to your process should have SA_RESTART behaviour; and the Single Unix
specification says nothing about signals you do not control. For instance,
you cannot trap SIGSTOP; SIGSTOP does not kill your process, which
should resume flawlessly at the next SIGCONT; and according to the
specification, it is valid for SIGSTOP and SIGCONT to <em>not</em>
have SA_RESTART behaviour. So if you get a SIGSTOP while performing
an interruptible system call, that system call may return -1 EINTR,
this is not an OS bug, and there's nothing you can do about it with
<tt>sigaction()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
 SA_RESTART is only a partial solution: in other words, it doesn't work.
Until the Single Unix specification explicitly states that untrapped
non-lethal signals MUST have SA_RESTART behaviour by default, you
<em>need</em> safe wrappers to protect interruptible system calls.
