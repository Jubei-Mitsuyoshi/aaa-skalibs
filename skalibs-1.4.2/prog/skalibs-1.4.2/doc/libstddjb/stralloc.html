<h1> The <tt>stralloc</tt> library interface </h1>

<p>
 The following functions are declared in the <tt>stralloc.h</tt> header,
and implemented in the <tt>libstddjb.a</tt> or <tt>libstddjb.so</tt> library.
</p>

<h2> General information </h2>

<p>
 <tt>stralloc</tt> is the preferred skalibs way of storing objects into
heap memory. It focuses on strings of <em>char</em>, which is the generic
way to handle any object. For easy structure manipulation, the
<a href="genalloc.html">genalloc</a>
series of functions can be used; those functions are mostly macros wrapping
calls to their stralloc counterparts.
</p>

<p>
 A stralloc is a structure containing the following fields:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <em>s</em>: a pointer to a zone of heap memory. The stralloc
functions internally manipulate those via the
<a href="alloc.html">alloc</a> series of functions. It is recommended
to never modify that field manually. </li>
 <li> <em>len</em>: the <strong>used</strong> length of the
allocated zone. It is the only field that the user can modify
directly. </li>
 <li> <em>a</em>: the number of allocated bytes. The user should never
have to access that field, because the memory allocation management
should be entirely transparent. <em>len</em> cannot exceed <em>a</em>:
if an operation needs a bigger <em>len</em>, it will automatically
reallocate as needed. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The benefits of using stralloc are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Memory allocation is performed on-demand and automatically, with
a suitable size. Heuristics are used to accommodate constantly growing
strings while minimizing the amount of needed reallocations. </li>
 <li> If every heap-allocated object is represented by a stralloc, then
it is very easy to identify what pointer is in the heap. When you stop
using a pointer <em>p</em>, should you free it&nbsp;? Sometimes it's not
easy to find out. When you stop using a stralloc <em>sa</em>, you
<em>know</em> you must call <tt>stralloc_free(&amp;sa)</tt>. Store
your strong references as strallocs and weak references as simple
pointers, and never free simple pointers. This policy allows me to
boast that <em>no skarnet.org software has ever leaked memory</em>. </li>
 <li> The indirection layer makes weak references immune to
reallocation troubles. The <em>s</em> field may change when a
reallocation happens, but the stralloc structure's address never
changes. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 A stralloc can be declared anywhere: BSS, stack or heap. (Of course,
as a general rule, you should favor the stack whenever possible.)
A stralloc should be initialized to STRALLOC_ZERO before its first use. 
</p>

<h2> Functions </h2>

<p>
<code> int stralloc_catb (stralloc *sa, char const *s, unsigned int len) </code> <br />
Appends the <em>len</em> bytes pointed to by <em>s</em> to the end of the
memory zone handled by *<em>sa</em>, automatically allocating more memory
if needed. Returns 1 if it succeeds, and 0 if it fails.
</p>

<p>
<code> void stralloc_free (stralloc *sa) </code> <br />
Frees <em>*sa</em>, i.e. calls <a href="alloc.html">alloc_free</a>
on <em>sa</em>&rarr;s then zeroes the structure. *<em>sa</em> is
then reusable. However, it is not good practice to call this function
if you're going to reuse *<em>sa</em> soon: it takes time and causes
memory fragmentation. Just setting <em>sa</em>&rarr;len to 0 allows
you to instantly reuse the allocated block of memory.
</p>

<p>
 The above are the most important and fundamental functions of
<tt>stralloc.h</tt>. Other functions can be found in this header and
their prototypes are self-explaining.
