<h1> What is that slashpackage convention and why are you recommending it&nbsp;? </h1>

<p>
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/slashpackage.html">slashpackage</a> is a convention
proposed by <a href="djblegacy.html">DJB</a> to have a reliable,
cross-platform way of accessing files.
</p>

<p>
(<a href="http://dogmap.org/">Paul Jarc</a> has a
<a href="http://code.dogmap.org/slashpackage/">presentation of
slashpackage</a> that you may want to view.)
</p>

<p>
 For instance, the
<a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a> package
follows the slashpackage convention by default: this means that, among others, the
<a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/execline/execlineb.html">execlineb</a>
binary can be found at <tt>/package/admin/execline/command/execlineb</tt>
<em>no matter the underlying installation, no matter the platform, no
matter the OS</em> - as long as the convention is followed.
</p>

<p>
 This is a key point for system reliability. It is especially important
for a script interpreter such as <tt>execlineb</tt>: people might
distribute scripts, starting with a #! line, and if the shebang path
is wrong on some machine, the script will break on that machine. Long
story short: <strong>packages should be able to hardcode paths to other
packages' components.</strong>
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/slashpackage/studies.html">The FHS alone does
not guarantee this.</a>
</p>

<h2> But the FHS is a widely adopted <em>standard</em>&nbsp;!
You cannot go against it&nbsp;! </h2>

<p>
 This is irrelevant for two reasons:
</p>

<ol>
 <li> Standards are not sacred <em>per se</em>. Standards are nothing
more than <em>conventions</em>. In the Unix world, there are two ways
for something to become a standard:
 <ul>
  <li> Be incredibly good, so good that everyone adopts it at once and
it booms, to everyone's benefit. Example:
<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791.txt">IPv4</a>. Even
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> could not compete
with it, and had to abandon their Microsoft Network and hop on the
Internet bandwagon. </li>
  <li> Have been there historically for ages, so everyone does the
same by inertia, and eventually become a de facto standard, technical
quality notwithstanding. Example:
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/gets.html">gets()</a>. </li>
 </ul>
 Guess what category the FHS belongs to. If you said the second one,
you're right: the FHS is only a standard because people simply never
bothered to question it and design anything better. </li>
 <li> Slashpackage <em>does not conflict</em> with the FHS, at all.
You can have your clean FHS hierarchy, with the <tt>execlineb</tt>
binary stored under <tt>/usr/bin</tt> or <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>,
<em>and</em> have it accessible as
<tt>/package/admin/execline/command/execlineb</tt>, thanks to this
wonderful Unix thing called a symbolic link. Slashpackage does not
care where files are <em>stored</em>; it only requires them to be
<em>accessible</em> via the <tt>/package</tt> hierarchy. So, why
not have the best of both worlds, and respect the FHS <em>and</em>
slashpackage&nbsp;? </li>
</ol>

<h2> I disagree with your first point: the FHS is a good standard. </h2>

<p>
 This is off-topic, but I'll address it here to be done with it.
</p>

<p>
 Yes, of course there are good points in the FHS. The people who designed
it in the first place were not idiots. However, this was a <em>long time</em>
ago, and the problems that had to be solved then are mostly irrelevant now.
</p>

<p>
 For instance, <tt>/usr</tt> was created so you could have a minimal
system on a local disk, then mount <tt>/usr</tt> via NFS. Mass storage
was a problem at the time, so it was easier and cheaper to only have
one copy of <tt>/usr</tt> on an NFS server. Today, we have lots of
cheap mass storage, and bootable CDs; the distinction between <tt>/bin</tt>
and <tt>/usr/bin</tt> is largely irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
 Same thing with <tt>/bin</tt> and <tt>/sbin</tt>. Why are some binaries
stored under <tt>/sbin</tt>&nbsp;? It's not to prevent the user from
accessing them: <tt>/sbin</tt> is world-readable on practically every
system. What is the benefit of having a separate <tt>/sbin</tt> for
administrator programs, over just putting those in <tt>/bin</tt>,
with a 0700 mode if one is paranoid&nbsp;? This one is left as an
exercise for the reader; but in any case, it does not make sense
today.
</p>

<p>
 The only filesystem hierarchy a modern system needs is the
following:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Have a place that can be mounted read-only, where system
binaries and data reside. (Currently, this is <tt>/usr</tt>;
this really should be the root filesystem.) </li>
 <li> Have a place that must be mounted read-write, for the
system to store variable data. (This is <tt>/var</tt>, and it
is a good thing.) </li>
 <li> Have a place that must be mounted read-write and that can
be mounted synchronously, to avoid losing important data such
as mail queues and logs. (<tt>/var/log</tt> can be used for
this; but the FHS says nothing about mail queues.) </li>
 <li> Have a place that can be mounted as a RAM filesystem.
(<tt>/tmp</tt> was not designed with this in mind, but it
fits the constraint perfectly.) </li>
 <li> Have a place for the users to do whatever they want.
(This is <tt>/home</tt>, and it is a good thing.) </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The FHS addresses this constraints well enough, but due to
historical legacy cruft, it does <em>way more</em> than is
necessary, and it adds complexity.
</p>

<p>
 The important point, though, is that there is ONE vital
thing that the FHS does not do: ensure cross-platform
accessibility of packages. I am not blaming the FHS: it was
not designed to do that. But the need is there, and denying
it only postpones the problems and makes life hard for users.
Since the FHS cannot address the need, we need <em>an
additional</em> convention. And slashpackage does the job.
</p>

<h2> We are a Unix distribution; our policy does not allow software
to install anything outside of the FHS-defined directories. If it
did, there would be chaos; we could not unify the software and
make a polished distribution for the users. </h2>

<p>
 I understand your point of view, but disagree with it.
Please read <a href="http://cr.yp.to/compatibility.html">this
page</a> about cross-platform compatibility.
</p>

<p>
 In my opinion, the right way for a Unix distribution to package
software is <strong>not</strong> to "unify" it and make a
"polished" distribution. It's to <strong>friggin' package
the software</strong>, i.e. provide a tarball and automatic
installation, configuration and removal scripts.
</p>

<p>
 By doing more than this, and especially by bypassing primary
authors' decisions about how files should be accessed, Unix
distributions are creating more work. More work for themselves,
because they have to maintain subtly different versions of
software than what the primary author provides; and more work
for the users, because instead of learning "execline", a user
now has to learn "Ubuntu execline", "Fedora execline", "OpenBSD
execline".
</p>

<p>
 Anyway, I have no objection to following the FHS. None at all. If you're
going to package my software, you're free to put the files wherever you
want. All I ask is that you <em>do</em> add symbolic links so files can
be accessed via <tt>/package</tt>, and via <tt>/command</tt> too for
executables.
If your policy does not allow it, then I ask that you:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> think about it and <strong>question that policy, and the people
who decided on it</strong>. Is it really necessary
to be such a nazi for <em>two subdirectories of <tt>/</tt></em>, that
can even be symbolic links to <tt>/opt/package</tt> and <tt>/opt/command</tt>
or whatever can make your life easier&nbsp;? What is more important,
having a "clean" <tt>/</tt> directory (and this is laughable when you
look at <tt>/media</tt> or <tt>/srv</tt>), or having reliable
hardcoded paths and happy users&nbsp;? </li>
 <li> if you can, <em>at least</em> have a slashpackage-style forest of
symlinks in a subdirectory of your choice - <tt>/usr/lib/slashpackage</tt>,
or <tt>/var/lib/slashpackage</tt>, or <tt>/opt/package</tt>, or whatever
you want. This way, users can still access files via their
slashpackage name; they just need to know the prefix. All of the
skarnet.org programs, all of the dogmap.org programs, and many more
slashpackage-aware pieces of software, natively support prefixed
slashpackage installations. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Be real. You're one of the two or three crackpots in the world who
follow that convention. All you're going to achieve is deter people
from using your software. </h2>

<p>
 Well, I used to not care at all, because I mainly write software for
myself, and quality - which includes reliability - is more important to me
than widespread use. (Seriously, if widespread use was a good metric for
quality, I'd be applying for a job at Microsoft.) After all, I'm rewriting
the world, so let me do it my way, right&nbsp;?
</p>

<p>
 However, I have come to realize that unlike actual software, a
<em>convention</em> is only good if it is <em>followed</em> by a
non-negligible amount of people. The Unix world is certainly ready for
better software, but it is apparently not ready for better filesystem
organization.
</p>

<p>
 So, starting in 2013, all skarnet.org releases now feature a way to
build and install software on a non-slashpackage installation. I hope
this will encourage more people to use it.
</p>

<p>
 This means some responsibility has been transferred from the author to
the packagers and the system administrators. If you are forfeiting the
slashpackage guarantees, then it is up to you to make sure things work.
In particular, you should pay attention to the following points:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Non-atomic package upgrade. (With slashpackage, upgrading software
from a release to another is atomic.) </li>
 <li> More generally, more painful package management. Hopefully, your
distribution does that for you. Hopefully, they don't screw things up
too badly. </li>
 <li> No guaranteed absolute paths. Executables have to rely on the PATH
environment variables to find other executables - even executables belonging
to the same package. This can be problematic if there is a name conflict. </li>
 <li> Script shebangs. If you can't portably write <tt>#!/command/execlineb</tt>,
then you have to edit your execline scripts to match your system. Is that
<tt>#!/bin/execlineb</tt>&nbsp;? <tt>#!/usr/bin/execlineb</tt>&nbsp;? Oh, I know the
solution&nbsp;! It's <tt>#!/usr/bin/env execlineb</tt>&nbsp;! But wait, is that
<tt>/usr/bin/env</tt> or <tt>/bin/env</tt>&nbsp;? Or <tt>/usr/local/bin/env</tt>
maybe&nbsp;? Damn. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 But it's your dime.
