<h1> How to cross-compile skalibs </h1>

<p>
 There are three issues in the world of cross-compilation:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> support for parallel builds: the source directory must be read-only
and each build process must have its own build tree. </li>
 <li> support for compiler options: to specify the target architecture,
the header and library files that should be used, etc.
 <li> build-time tests performed on the build architecture are invalid
if the target architecture is different. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Starting with release 0.26, skalibs tries to address those issues.
</p>

<h2> Support for parallel builds </h2>

<p>
 Let's assume that:
</p>

 <ul>
  <li> You untarred the <tt>skalibs-$VERSION.tar.gz</tt> archive into <tt>$BUILDROOT</tt>. </li>
  <li> You made a symlink <tt>$BUILDROOT/prog/skalibs -> skalibs-$VERSION</tt>.
(This is not really necessary, but it allows you to access the skalibs source
tree as <tt>$BUILDROOT/prog/skalibs</tt> no matter the version number.) </li>
</ul>
You now have a few subdirectories in the <tt>$BUILDROOT/prog/skalibs</tt> directory:
<ul>
 <li> <tt>conf-compile</tt>. This is where you will write compilation options. </li>
 <li> <tt>doc</tt>. The skalibs documentation you are currently reading. Not used
in the build process. </li>
 <li> <tt>package</tt>. Build system scripts and general package information.
You should <em>not</em> modify anything there unless you know exactly
what you are doing. </li>
 <li> <tt>src</tt>. The source tree. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 <em>None</em> of those directories are written into by the skalibs build
system. Instead, the build scripts create the following directories:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>compile</tt>. This is where all the compilation takes place.
Every source file will be symlinked there, and object files will be
created there. </li>
 <li> <tt>include</tt>. This is where the target header files will
reside after the compilation. </li>
 <li> <tt>library</tt>. This is where the target static library files will
reside after the compilation. </li>
 <li> <tt>library.so</tt>. This is where the target shared library files,
if any, will reside after the compilation.
 <li> <tt>sysdeps</tt>. This is where the target system-specific
information will reside after build-time autodetection or manual
importing. More on that below. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 To prepare for a build in a separate place - say, in
<tt>$ARCHROOT/skalibs</tt> - that will not modify the directory
where the sources have been unpacked, so that parallel builds can
occur, you should then take the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> mkdir <tt>$ARCHROOT/skalibs</tt> </li>
 <li> symlink the <tt>$BUILDROOT/prog/skalibs/package</tt> and
<tt>$BUILDROOT/prog/skalibs/src</tt> directory into
<tt>$ARCHROOT/skalibs</tt> </li>
 <li> mkdir <tt>$ARCHROOT/skalibs/conf-compile</tt> </li>
</ul>

<p>
 You now have your own arch-specific <tt>$ARCHROOT/skalibs</tt>
tree; it's time to fill it with arch-specific options.
</p>

<h2> Support for build-time options </h2>

<p>
 The first line of <tt>conf-compile/conf-cc</tt> must be
the command line used to compile a .c file into a .o file:
for instance, <tt>gcc&nbsp;-c</tt>. <br />
If you're using a "GNU&nbsp;configure"-type system with
<tt>$CC</tt> and <tt>$CFLAGS</tt>, the following line should be enough:
</p>

<pre>
  echo ${CC} ${CFLAGS} > conf-compile/conf-cc
</pre>

<p>
 Similarly, the first line of <tt>conf-compile/conf-ld</tt> must be
the command line used to link .o and .a files into an executable:
for instance, <tt>gcc&nbsp;-s</tt>. <br />
With a "GNU&nbsp;configure"-type system, the following line should do
the trick:
</p>

<pre>
  echo ${CC} ${LDFLAGS} > conf-compile/conf-ld
</pre>

<p>
  Now, there is another file: <tt>conf-compile/conf-egd</tt>.
If you're going to perform build-time autodetection, you need to 
provide it now:
</p>

<pre>
  echo path-to-the-target-EGD-socket > conf-compile/conf-egd
</pre>

<p>
 or, if you won't be using EGD, just
</p>

<pre>
  echo > conf-compile/conf-egd
</pre>

<p>
But you probably do not need to do that, because you will be providing
your own sysdeps.
</p>

<p>
 Starting with 0.27: there are two other files,
 <tt>conf-stripbins</tt> and <tt>conf-striplibs</tt>.
Since skalibs does not provide any executables, and since you are
cross-compiling, avoid trouble and do not strip anything:
</p>

<pre>
  echo > conf-compile/conf-stripbins
  echo > conf-compile/conf-striplibs
</pre>

<p>
 Starting with 1.0.0: you can also set flags by touching files
in <tt>conf-compile/</tt>. <a href="flags.html">This page</a>
explains how flags work.
</p>

<h2> Bypassing the build-time tests </h2>

<p>
 The "normal" skalibs build procedure, <tt>package/compile</tt>, performs
the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
 <li> finding the target's (i.e. here the build arch's) <em>systype</em> </li>
 <li> building correct compilation scripts from the <em>systype</em> and the
information you gave in <tt>conf-compile</tt> </li>
 <li> making some build-time tests to gather <em>sysdeps</em>, i.e.
arch-specific information, used in the sources to work around possible
portability problems </li>
 <li> compiling the portable sources. </li>
</ol>

<p>
 In a cross-compilation environment, the steps 1 and 3 are clearly invalid:
the autodetected <em>systype</em> and <em>sysdeps</em> will be the build
architecture's, not the target architecture's. There is only one way to
cross-compile portable code without resorting to build-time autodetection:
<strong>you must provide by hand the sysdeps for your target
architecture</strong>.
</p>

<p>
 The easiest way to get the "right" sysdeps for a target achitecture is
to natively compile skalibs on that target, and steal the produced sysdeps
files. You could also (politely) ask for precompiled sysdeps on the
skaware mailing-list.
</p>

<p>
 The most powerful way to get the sysdeps would be to have a
program such as <em>GNU&nbsp;autoconf</em> automatically generate them
at build-time. I won't convert skalibs to autoconf, but contributions
such as autoconf-to-sysdeps scripts are welcome.
</p>

<p>
 <a href="http://www.kegel.com/">Dan Kegel</a> has kindly provided some
<a href="dank-cross-notes.html">step-by-step notes</a> on making sysdeps
files for your target architecture. With the 1.0.0 release, the skalibs
build system has somewhat changed and a lot of sysdeps have been added,
so these notes are obsolete; but they might still be useful to you. 
</p>

<h2> Launching the cross-compilation process </h2>

<p>
 So at this point:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> You have filled up <tt>conf-compile</tt> with the configuration
options and flags you need. </li>
 <li> You have gotten hold of, or hand-made, a predefined set of sysdeps
in <tt>$SYSDEPSDIR</tt>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 You can't perform <tt>make</tt>, that would launch the native compilation
process and ignore your <tt>$SYSDEPSDIR</tt>. Instead, skalibs provides
a script for you to run:
</p>

<pre>
  package/crosscompile ${SYSDEPSDIR}
</pre>

<p>
 The set of sysdeps in <tt>$SYSDEPSDIR</tt> will be imported into the
build tree, and the portable sources will be compiled. The header files
will be produced in the <tt>include</tt> directory, the static library
files in the <tt>library</tt> directory, and the shared library files,
if any, in the <tt>library.so</tt> directory. That's it.
</p>
