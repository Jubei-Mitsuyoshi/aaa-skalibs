/command:/usr/bin:/bin

This will be the default executable search path used by pathexec_run()
when no PATH environment variable is defined. The value should not
really matter since PATH should always be defined. If you are not
following the slashcommand convention, though, you might want to
set it to /usr/bin:/bin.
