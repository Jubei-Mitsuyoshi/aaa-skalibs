--  If your system has the /dev/random device, the compilation might hang for
-- several minutes on the next "choose" line. This is normal and depends on
-- the amount of hardware entropy in the computer.
--  To generate hardware entropy and allow the compilation process to resume,
-- you can move the mouse around, or start other processes in parallel.
-- You can also just wait for entropy to increase naturally.
